I am a graduate student at the [Department of Computer Sciences](https://cs.utexas.edu){:target="_blank"}, [University of Texas at Austin](https://utexas.edu){:target="_blank"}.
I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Aditya Akella](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/) at the UT Networked Systems ([UTNS](https://utns.cs.utexas.edu/)) lab.
Earlier I was an RA in the same group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  

I am broadly interested in Systems and Networking, with current focus on microservice and serverless deployments. Most recently, I have been investigating microservice deployments from two aspects - communication and learned autoscaling.  

I like to think about and come up with design principles to make computer systems efficient, performant and usable.
<!-- I'm fascinated by questions such as "Can we bring datacenter-like capabilities to the end-users?" or "What are the fundamental constraints in the networked systems we use?". -->
As a long term goal, it is my desire to bridge the gap between research and ground reality by working on socially utilizable projects.

Previously, I was an undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} majoring in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitd.ac.in){:target="_blank"} where I met and made friends with some absolutely amazing and competent people. I hail from [Lucknow](https://goo.gl/maps/yNiHPh9WgNbjwPeH9){:target="_blank"}, a city in Northern India.

<!-- **_I am actively seeking internships for Summer 2022._** -->
